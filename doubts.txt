when to use accessmodifier name before a class...??? depends on how we will access the class  

if we have many subclasses in pgrm, how to access the members of oneclass to another class..???


method name and class name should be same???... answer == then it will be constuctor..


if not how will we cal the method of one class to another class..??    ==  referencename.methodname

Multiple markers at this line
	- The method println(boolean) in the type PrintStream is not applicable for the 
	 arguments (void)
	- Syntax error on token "s", delete this token
	- The method summeth() is undefined for the type String...............error

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 
	The method println(boolean) in the type PrintStream is not applicable for the arguments (void)

	at mixofmethandclassum.main(mixofmethandclassum.java:7)

if println is a boolean type then how can we print the results of other datatypes.

...> if the class is public and all the methods in the class should be public, it shouldnot be contriductory....
